HIGH LEVEL GOALS:
	Neural Network solution
	Higher user interaction

TO DO?
	- Neural Network solution (NNS)
		- Show NNS alongside Classifier solution (CS)
	- Multiple Classifier solutions (CSs)
		- Radio selection to allow user to select what CS to use
	- Multiple Neural Network solutions (NNSs)
		- Radio selection to allow user to select what NNS to use
	- Better image scaling
		- Allow user to define image dimensions?

FUNC REQ
	- User must be able to choose what classifier solution to use
	- User must be able to choose what neural network solution to use
	- User must be able to define scaled image dimensions
	- Site must display results of both selected solutions side-by-side
